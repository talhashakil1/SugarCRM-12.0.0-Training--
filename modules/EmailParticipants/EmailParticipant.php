/**
 * Class EmailParticipant
 *
 * EmailParticipants beans should not be saved directly. They are an entity that is only used in relationships with
 * Emails. Add or remove from those relationships to make changes to the participants of an email. This enables the
 * relationship strategies to enforce certain behaviors regarding the sender and recipients of an email.
 * EmailParticipants beans will be saved via {@link SugarRelationship::resaveRelatedBeans()}. The only exception is
 * {@link RelateRecordApi::createRelatedRecord}, whose flow results in the saving an EmailParticipants bean, but does so
 * such that the beans are linked during the save operation, allowing for the relationship strategies to enforce their
 * rules.
