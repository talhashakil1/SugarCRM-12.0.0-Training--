What is CLI Upgrader?
---------------------

The CLI Upgrader is a stand-alone PHP script that can be run from the command prompt
for upgrading a Sugar instance. 

Why is CLI Upgrader useful for Upgrades?
------------------------------------------------------

Sugar upgrades can potentially require resources that are sometimes beyond the Web
execution environment settings. Using the CLI Upgrader enables you to avoid some of
the limitations that the Web application environment may have that prevent the Web
upgrader from completing the upgrade. The upload size limit (by PHP and sometimes
even by Web server), the CGI (or equivalent) timeout limit, and the MySQL (or
equivalent) session timeout limit are some of the challenges people run into when
upgrading. The CLI Upgrader either avoids the limitations or better controls the
settings in its stand-alone execution environment.

How do you run CLI Upgrader?
---------------------------------

To execute the CLI Upgrader script, you need to supply the parameters, as described
in the Arguments section below.

Usage: php CliUpgrader.php -z upgradeZipFile -l logFile -s pathToSugarInstance -u admin-user

Example:
    [path-to-PHP/]php CliUpgrader.php -z [path-to-upgrade-package/]SugarEnt-Upgrade-6.5.x-to-7.5.0.zip -l [path-to-log-file/]silentupgrade.log -s path-to-sugar-instance/ -u admin

Arguments:
    -z/--zip upgradeZipFile              : Upgrade package file.
    -l/--log logFile                     : Upgrade log file (by default relative to instance dir)
    -s/--source pathToSugarInstance      : Sugar instance being upgraded.
    -u/--user admin-user                 : admin user performing the upgrade
Optional arguments:
    -m/--mask scriptMask                 : Script mask - which types of scripts to run.
                                           Supported types: core, db, custom, all, none. Default is all.
    -b/--backup 0/1                      : Create backup of deleted files? 0 means no backup, default is 1.
    -S/--stage stage                     : Run specific stage of the upgrader. 'continue' means start where it stopped last time.
    -A/--autoconfirm                     : Automatic confirm health check results (use with caution !)

Upgrading the Sugar Database Schema: 
------------------------------------- 

The CLI Upgrader will automatically replace the current database schema with the
new version schema.

Compatibility matrix for the CLI Upgrader:
----------------------------------------------

You can view the compatibility matrix online at:
http://support.sugarcrm.com/05_Resources/03_Supported_Platforms

Note: The CliUpgrader.php script creates new files for the OS user who is running it.
For example, for the root user it will create files as user/group root. Because Apache may
not be able to read these files, you must ensure that the Web server user has the
permissions to read and write the files.
