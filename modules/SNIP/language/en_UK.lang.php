Each Sugar instance has its own unique email address. To import emails, a user sends to the provided email address using the TO, CC, BCC fields. The Email Archiving service will import the email into the Sugar instance. The service imports the email, along with any attachments, images and Calendar events, and creates records within the application that are associated with existing records based on matching email addresses.<br />    <br><br>Example: As a user, when I view an Account, I will be able to see all the emails that are  associated with the Account based on the email address in the Account record.  I will also be able to see emails that are associated with Contacts related to the Account.<br />    <br><br>Accept the terms below and click Enable to start using the service. You will be able to disable the service at any time. Once the service is enabled, the email address to use for the service will be displayed.<br />    <br><br>",
