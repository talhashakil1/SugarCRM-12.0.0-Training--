<h2>Overview</h2>
<span class="lead">
    List current user's filtered Activity Stream dashboards.
</span>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<span class="lead">
    This endpoint will return a set of Activity Stream dashboards filtered by an expression. The filter can be applied
    to multiple fields and have multiple and/or conditions in it. Alternatively, you may use an existing filter by
    specifying its id. If both a filter definition and a filter id are passed, the two filters will be joined with an
    <code>AND</code>. Care will need to be taken to make sure that any filters used have appropriate indexes on the
    server side otherwise the runtime of the endpoint will be very long.
</span>

<h2>Notice</h2>
<span class="lead">
    <strong>The behavior of this endpoint has changed in v11.</strong> If you continue to use v10 of the API, your
    REST calls should behave as below. But, it is advisable to upgrade to v11.<br/>
    <strong>Migrating to v11:</strong><br/>
    For more information on behavior in v11, refer to <a href="module_filter_get_help.html">GET /&lt;module&gt;</a>.
    <br/>
    Recommended Replacement:
    <code class="codesample">GET /Dashboards</code><br/><br/>
    The module name is no longer part of the path. To specify a module name, include it as a filter
    parameter, use<br/>
    <strong>v11: </strong>
    <code class="codesample">GET /Dashboards?filter[0][dashboard_module]=Activities</code><br/><br/>
    name, id. etc. are no longer specified as default fields. To retain the default fields, use<br/>
    <strong>v11: </strong>
    <code class="codesample">
        GET /Dashboards?filter[0][dashboard_module]=Activities&amp;fields=id,name,view_name
    </code>
