<h2>Overview</h2>
<span class="lead">
    Lists filtered records.
</span>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<span class="lead">
    This endpoint will return a set of records filtered by an expression. The filter can be applied to multiple fields
    and have multiple and/or conditions in it. Alternatively, you may use an existing filter by specifying its id.
    If both a filter definition and a filter id are passed, the two filters will be joined with an <code>AND</code>.
    Care will need to be taken to make sure that any filters used have appropriate indexes on the server side otherwise
    the runtime of the endpoint will be very long. Related fields can be searched by specifying the field name as:
    "link_name.remote_field", so if you wished to search the Accounts module by a related member account you would
    use "members.sic_code".

            The filter expression. Filter expressions are explained below.
            Note that JSON-encoded filters can be specified as query parameters
            in one of two ways for GET requests:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    By specifying individual filter arguments as distinct parameters.
                    Example: <code class="codesample">filter[0][id]=1</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By specifying the whole filter as a single JSON-encoded string.
                    Note that this syntax is currently not supported on certain modules.
                    Example: <code class="codesample">filter=[{"id":"1"}]</code>.

            Comma delimited list of fields to return. Each field may be represented either by string, or by map
            containing field name and additional field parameters (applicable to link and collection fields).
            The fields <code>id</code> and <code>date_modified</code> will always be returned.
            <br>
            Example: <code>name,account_type,description,{"name":"opportunities","fields":["id","name","sales_status"],"order_by":"date_closed:desc"}</code>

            Instead of defining the fields argument, the view argument can be used instead. The field list is
            constructed at the server side based on the view definition which is requested. This argument can be used
            in combination with the fields argument. Common views are "record" and "list".

<h3>Filter Expressions</h3>
<span class="lead">
There are four types of filters:
</span>

<h4>Basic</h4>
<div class="well well-small">
    This will filter the results by checking the field "name" for value "Nelson Inc". This will only find exact matches.

<h5>Example</h5>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
{
   "filter":[
      {
         "name":"Nelson Inc"
      }
   ]
}
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Full</h4>

<div class="well well-small">
    This expression allows you to specify what operation you want to use for filtering on the field. In the example you
    would match any record where the field "name" starts with the value "Nelson".

    <h5>Example</h5>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
{
   "filter":[
      {
         "name":{
            "$starts":"Nelson"
         }
      }
   ]
}

</div>

<h4>Sub-expressions</h4>

<div class="well well-small">
    This allows you to group filter expressions into or/and groupings. By default all expressions are and'ed together.
    The example expression would match if the field "name" was either "Nelson Inc" or "Nelson LLC". The only currently
    accepted sub-expression types are "$and" and "$or".

    <h5>Example</h5>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
{
   "filter":[
      {
         "$or":[
            {
               "name":"Nelson Inc"
            },
            {
               "name":"Nelson LLC"
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Modules</h4>
<div class="well well-small">
    There are two module expressions, they operate on modules instead of fields. The current module can be specified by
    either using the module name "_this" or by leaving the module name as a blank string. The example expression would
    filter the records in the current module to only your favorites. The only currently accepted module expressions are
    "$favorite" and "$owner".

<h5>Example</h5>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
{
   "filter":[
      {
         "$favorite":"_this"
      }
   ]
}
</pre>
