<h2>Overview</h2>
<span class="lead">
    List a set of cases accessible to a contact with portal visibility.
</span>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<span class="lead">
    This endpoint will return a set of cases filtered by an expression which are accesible to a contact with portal visibility.
    The filter can be applied to multiple fields and have multiple and/or conditions in it. Alternatively, you may use an existing filter by
    specifying its id. If both a filter definition and a filter id are passed, the two filters will be joined with an
    <code>AND</code>. Care will need to be taken to make sure that any filters used have appropriate indexes on the
    server side otherwise the runtime of the endpoint will be very long. For more information, refer to <a href="module_filter_get_help.html">GET /&lt;module&gt;</a>
