                Pruning the team sets tables means
                1) Backing up the denormalization table (if denorm is enabled), and the team_sets, team_sets_teams and team_sets_modules tables.
                   Backup tables start with 'tsp_' and end with a datetime stamp, '_MMDDHHMM'
                2) Truncating the original tables.
                3) Copying the active team sets out of the backup tables and into the truncated original tables, 
                   and leaving out the unused team sets.
                   \"Active\" team sets are team sets that are used by at least one record in sugar, i.e. a Case or an Account.
