            You don't need to run this command before you run teamset:prune.
            This command only backs up the team set tables. This is performed automatically when you run teamset:prune.
            But if you want backups of these tables for some other purpose, you can use this command to do so easily.
            It will back up these tables: team_sets, team_sets_teams, team_sets_modules, and the active denorm table
            (team_sets_users_[1|2])if denormalization is enabled.
